# Trellis

Grow your own homepage!

## What is this?

Trellis is a web-based dashboard for collecting useful widgets.  If you want a
browser homepage with data shared between devices, this could be for you!

## Does it work?

Maybe?  I'm still experimenting with what I want it to be, so I don't even know
what it means for it to "work".  It compiles, at least!

## Development

This is a hobby project that I'm using as a way to learn Rust, WebAssembly, and
Elm-style app architecture.  This means that the app and the code will almost
certainly be bad (but improving?).  If you have constructive feedback, I'd be
glad to hear it!
